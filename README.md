# CamelBot

CamelBot is a next generation bot that's intended to be used anywhere.

Because it's not tied to any specific platform, there are infinitely many ways to use it.
CamelBot is designed to impliment `interfaces` and `plugins`. For example, one might install an interface for Discord
and a plugin to moderate a channel. 

WARNING: CamelBot is in high development and may cause issues.
